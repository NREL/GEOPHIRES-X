3.7
^^^

`release <https://github.com/NREL/GEOPHIRES-X/releases/tag/v3.7.0>`__ | `diff <https://github.com/NREL/GEOPHIRES-X/compare/v3.6.0...v3.7.0>`__

3.6
^^^

`release <https://github.com/NREL/GEOPHIRES-X/releases/tag/v3.6.0>`__ | `diff <https://github.com/NREL/GEOPHIRES-X/compare/v3.5.0...v3.6.0>`__

Changes default output file path to the original working directory instead of the the GEOPHIRES module source directory (usually ``geophires-x`` or ``src/geophires_x``, depending on package installation type).
This affects:

1. Users who call GEOPHIRES as a script from a working directory outside of the module source directory and pass no output file argument or a non-absolute output file argument e.g. ``python ./geophires-x/GEOPHIRESv3.py my-input.txt``. In prior versions, the output file would have been generated at ``./geophires_x/HDR.out``; in v.3.6 it is generated at ``./HDR.out`` instead. (Users who call GEOPHIRES as a module – ``python -m geophires_x my-input.txt`` – will see no change since the module has always output relative to the working directory.)

2. Inputs with ``HTML Output File`` and/or ``Improved Text Output File`` parameters specified as non-absolute paths. The associated output files will now be generated relative to the working directory instead of the GEOPHIRES module source directory.


Affected users who do not want the new behavior can specify absolute output paths instead of relative ones e.g. ``python ./geophires-x/GEOPHIRESv3.py my-input.txt /home/user/my-geophires-project/geophires-x/HDR.out``
(Most users are expected to be unaffected.)

3.6.1: Fixed Internal Rate default value changed to 7% from 6.25% per https://github.com/NREL/GEOPHIRES-X/issues/301

3.6.3: Discount Rate and Fixed Internal Rate are now synonymous. If one is provided, the other's value will be automatically set to the same value.

Versioning Notes
----------------

GEOPHIRES 3.0 (GEOPHIRES-X) and subsequent releases use `semantic versioning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Semantic_versioning>`__.
Major, minor, and notable patch versions are documented above.
You may also be interested in viewing the list of all PRs merged into the repository `here <https://github.com/NREL/GEOPHIRES-X/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+>`__.

Each semantic version has a corresponding tag, the full list of which can be viewed `here <https://github.com/NREL/GEOPHIRES-X/tags>`__.
The patch version displayed on the package badge in the README and patch versions explicitly mentioned in this changelog are always suitable for public consumption;
but note that not all patch version tags in the list are meant for public consumption
as intermediate internal-only patch versions are sometimes introduced during the development process.
(Improved designation and distribution of releases for public consumption may eventually be addressed by
`publishing to PyPI <https://github.com/NREL/GEOPHIRES-X/issues/117>`__ and/or use of
`GitHub releases <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases>`__.)
