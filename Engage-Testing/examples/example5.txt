Example 5 Description: This example problem considers an EGS reservoir at 3 km depth with
bottom-hole temperature of 150deg.C. The reservoir output temperature is imported from
the text file "ReservoirOutput.txt". Ramey's model is applied to simulate production
wellbore heat losses. The heat is used in a direct-use heat application with reinjection
temperature of 80deg.C.
