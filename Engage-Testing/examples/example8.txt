Geothermal Direct-Use Heat using Multiple Parallel Fractures Model (EGS)

Example 8 Description: This problem considers an EGS reservoir at 2.8 km depth for direct-use (Cornell conditions).
Ramey's model is applied to simulate production wellbore heat losses. The heat
is used in for direct-use heating with a reinjection temperature of 30deg.C.
