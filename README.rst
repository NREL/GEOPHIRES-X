GEOPHIRES is a free and open-source geothermal techno-economic simulator. GEOPHIRES combines reservoir, wellbore, surface plant, and economic models to estimate the capital and operation and maintenance costs, instantaneous and lifetime energy production, and overall levelized cost of energy of a geothermal plant. Various reservoir conditions (EGS, doublets, etc.) and end-use options (electricity, direct-use heat, cogeneration) can be modeled. Users are encouraged to build upon to the GEOPHIRES framework to implement their own correlations and models.

GEOPHIRES-X is the successor version to `GEOPHIRES v2.0 <https://github.com/NREL/GEOPHIRES-v2>`_ (see `CHANGELOG <CHANGELOG.rst>`__ for more info).

Documentation
=============

Manuals & Usage:

- A GEOPHIRES-X-specific user manual `is pending <https://github.com/NREL/python-geophires-x/issues/23>`_ as of 2023-10-19. In the meantime, the `GEOPHIRES v2.0 user manual <References/GEOPHIRES%20v2.0%20User%20Manual.pdf>`_ remains partially relevant.

- `How to extend GEOPHIRES-X <docs/How-to-extend-GEOPHIRES-X.md>`__ user guide

- `test_geophires_x.py <tests/test_geophires_x.py>`_ has examples of how to consume and call `GeophiresXClient <src/geophires_x_client/__init__.py#L14>`_ locally (i.e. if consuming GEOPHIRES-X as a pip package)

References:

- Theoretical basis for GEOPHIRES:  `GEOPHIRES v2.0: updated geothermal techno‚Äêeconomic simulation tool <References/Beckers%202019%20GEOPHIRES%20v2.pdf>`_
- Additional materials in `/References </References>`_


Installation
============

Strongly recommended prerequisite: always install in a `virtual environment <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html#via-pip>`_ (rather than global site-packages).

To consume GEOPHIRES-X as a python package, install the in-development version with::

    pip install https://github.com/NREL/python-geophires-x/archive/main.zip

(Eventually package will be published to PyPi, enabling ``pip install geophires-x``)

If you wish to add your own extensions (as described in `How to extend GEOPHIRES-X <How-to-extend-GEOPHIRES-X.md>`__) one option is to do an `editable install <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/>`_::

   pip install -e git+https://github.com/NREL/python-geophires-x.git#egg=geophires-x

If you are interested in sharing your extensions with others (or even contributing them back to this repository),
follow `the Development instructions <CONTRIBUTING.rst#development>`_ instead.

Development
