# 500 MWe EGS Case Study Modeled on Fervo Cape Station

This case study - example name: `Fervo_Project_Cape-4` - is modeled
on Fervo Cape Station with
its [announced upsizing from 400 MW to 500 MW](https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-announces-31-mw-power-purchase-agreement-with-shell-energy/),
using a combination of publicly available data, extrapolations, and estimates. The tables below highlight key input
assumptions and
comparison of results with reference values.

| Fraction of Investment in Bonds (percent debt vs. equity) | 28.6%                                                                    | It is estimated that Fervo currently has more equity financing than debt financing. This particular value is tuned  in conjunction with discount rate and interest rate to create a WACC of 8.3% per https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fervo-energy-technology-day-2024-entering-geothermal-decade-matson-n4stc. Note that this source says that Fervo ultimately wants to target "15% sponsor equity, 15% bridge loan, and 70% construction to term loans", but this case study does not attempt to model that capital structure. |
