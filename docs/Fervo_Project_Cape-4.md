# Case Study: 500 MWe EGS Project Modeled on Fervo Cape Station

The GEOPHIRES example `Fervo_Project_Cape-4` is a case study of a 500 MWe EGS Project modeled
on Fervo Cape Station with its April 2025-announced
[upsizing from 400 MW to 500 MW](https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-announces-31-mw-power-purchase-agreement-with-shell-energy/).
Case study inputs are formulated using a combination of publicly available data, extrapolations, and estimates.
Financial results are calculated
using
the [SAM Single Owner PPA Economic Model](https://softwareengineerprogrammer.github.io/GEOPHIRES/SAM-Economic-Models.html#sam-single-owner-ppa).

Key case study results include LCOE = $81.1/MWh and CAPEX = $5000/kW.

## Approach & Methodology

The case study is constructed to be representative of a 500 MWe EGS project similar to Cape Station,
although it is not intended to be an exact facsimile.
This is because not all relevant data points are publicly available (e.g. full PPA terms) while others may not be
applicable
outside of Cape Station's first-of-a-kind status (such as drilling costs of initial wells which were more expensive
at [$4.8–9.4M per well](https://houston.innovationmap.com/fervo-energy-drilling-utah-project-2667300142.html)).

Exact values were used for publicly available technical and engineering parameters, such as reservoir
density ([2800 kg/m³](https://doi.org/10.31223/X52X0B)).
Some technical parameters were inferred with high confidence from publicly available data, such as geothermal
gradient ([74 ℃/km](https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/db/GeoConf/papers/SGW/2024/Fercho.pdf)) and well diameter.
Other parameters were extrapolated or speculatively estimated based on plausibility and/or compatibility with known
results, such as number of doublets.

The Inputs and Results tables below document key assumptions, inputs, and a comparison of results with reference
values.
Note that these are not the complete sets of inputs and results, which are available in source code and
the [web interface](https://gtp.scientificwebservices.com/geophires/?geophires-example-id=Fervo_Project_Cape-4).

This baseline assumes standard sand proppant. The 15% contingency (~$0.6M) accounts for the necessary upgrade to ceramic proppant, which is required to resist mechanical crushing and geochemical degradation (diagenesis) over a 30-year well life at 200°C (Ko et al., 2023; Shiozawa & McClure, 2014). |

| Plant Lifetime                | 30 years                   | 30-year well life per Fervo Energy, 2025 (Geothermal Mythbusting: Water Use and Impacts).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Note that the Inflation Rate During Construction parameter hedges against potential construction delays.                                                                                                                                               |
| Well diameter                 | 9⅝ inches                  | Next standard size up from 7", implied by announcement of "increasing casing diameter"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Flow Rate per Production Well | 107 kg/s                   | Fercho et al, 2025 models reservoir performance using 100 kg/s per well. The announced increased casing diameter implies higher flow rates, so the case study uses the maximum flow rate achieved at Cape Station of 107 kg/s per Fervo Energy, 2024.                                                                                          |

(Note this is not a direct GEOPHIRES input parameter but was used to calculate other case study GEOPHIRES input parameters such as reservoir volume.)                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Fracture Separation           | 18 m                       | Per Norbeck et al, 2024: lateral length is 4700 ft = 1432 m. Dividing 1432 by 80 = ~18 m fracture spacing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Water Loss Rate               | 15%                        | Water loss rate is conservatively estimated to be between 10 and 20%. Other estimates and some simulations may suggest a significantly lower water loss rate than this conservative estimate.

## Uncertainty & Sensitivities

Given the methodological approach, including speculative estimation of some input parameters, and lack of real-world
reference data for comparison, the case study results are subject to uncertainty. Users may wish to perform their own
sensitivity analysis using [GEOPHIRES's Monte Carlo simulation module](Monte-Carlo-User-Guide.html) or other data analysis tools.

### Stimulation & Construction Inflation Costs

The following heatmaps visualize Electricity breakeven price (LCOE) and NPV sensitivity to stimulation cost and inflation costs during construction (a proxy for construction delays and cost overruns).
Stimulation costs were tested from $2.3M/well (Reservoir Stimulation Capital Cost Adjustment Factor = 0.5) to $9.2M/well (Reservoir Stimulation Capital Cost Adjustment Factor = 2).
Construction inflation costs were tested from $53.58M (Inflation Rate During Construction = 2.3%) to $340.13M (Inflation Rate During Construction = 14.6%).
