# Case Study: 500 MWe EGS Project Modeled on Fervo Cape Station

The GEOPHIRES example `Fervo_Project_Cape-4` is a case study of a 500 MWe EGS Project modeled
on Fervo Cape Station with its April 2025-announced
[upsizing from 400 MW to 500 MW](https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-announces-31-mw-power-purchase-agreement-with-shell-energy/).
Case study inputs are formulated using a combination of publicly available data, extrapolations, and estimates.
Financial results are calculated
using
the [SAM Single Owner PPA Economic Model](https://softwareengineerprogrammer.github.io/GEOPHIRES/SAM-Economic-Models.html#sam-single-owner-ppa).

Key case study results include LCOE = $76.3/MWh and CAPEX = $4340/kW.

interactively explore the case study in the GEOPHIRES web interface.

## Approach & Methodology

The case study is constructed to be representative of a 500 MWe EGS project similar to Cape Station,
although it is not intended to be an exact facsimile.
This is because not all relevant data points are publicly available (e.g. full PPA terms) while others may not be
applicable
outside of Cape Station's first-of-a-kind status (such as drilling costs of initial wells which were more expensive
at [$4.8–9.4M per well](https://houston.innovationmap.com/fervo-energy-drilling-utah-project-2667300142.html)).

Exact values were used for publicly available technical and engineering parameters, such as reservoir
density ([2800 kg/m³](https://doi.org/10.31223/X52X0B)).
Some technical parameters were inferred with high confidence from publicly available data, such as geothermal
gradient ([74 ℃/km](https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/db/GeoConf/papers/SGW/2024/Fercho.pdf)) and well diameter.
Other parameters were extrapolated or speculatively estimated based on plausibility and/or compatibility with known
results, such as number of doublets.

The Inputs and Results tables below document key assumptions, inputs, and a comparison of results with reference
values.
Note that these are not the complete sets of inputs and results, which are available in source code and
the [web interface](https://gtp.scientificwebservices.com/geophires/?geophires-example-id=Fervo_Project_Cape-4).

## Uncertainty & Sensitivities

Given the methodological approach, including speculative estimation of some input parameters, and lack of real-world
reference data for comparison, the case study results are subject to uncertainty. This case study does not attempt to
quantify uncertainties, but sensitivity analysis may be included in future updates. Users may wish to perform their own
sensitivity analysis using [GEOPHIRES's Monte Carlo simulation module](Monte-Carlo-User-Guide.html) or other data
analysis
tools.
