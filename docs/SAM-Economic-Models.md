# SAM Economic Models

SAM Economic Models leverage [NREL's SAM Financial Models](https://sam.nrel.gov/financial-models.html)
by transforming GEOPHIRES parameters into SAM parameters and running SAM with [PySAM](https://github.com/NREL/pysam).

## SAM Single-Owner PPA

SAM Financial
Model: [Power Purchase Agreement (PPA): Single owner](https://sam.nrel.gov/financial-models/utility-scale-ppa)

### Parameters

The following table describes how GEOPHIRES parameters are transformed into SAM parameters, as implemented in
[EconomicsSam.py](https://github.com/softwareengineerprogrammer/GEOPHIRES/blob/274786e6799d32dad3f42a2a04297818b811f24c/src/geophires_x/EconomicsSam.py#L135-L195).
(Note that the source code implementation determines actual behavior in the case of any discrepancies.)

.. <RST_Comment>
.. Comment entries of ".. N/A" render as blank in the final RST, by design.
.. This entry value is required because m2r2 (https://pypi.org/project/m2r2/) seems to choke and bail on rendering
.. the entire table when blank comment entries are blank. Make sure to check this doesn't happen when making changes
.. to this file by running `tox -e docs` and opening `dist/docs/SAM-Economic-Models.html` in your browser!
