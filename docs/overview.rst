GEOPHIRES Reference Manual
============================

This is a living document designed to be used with the
`GEOPHIRES v3 User Manual <https://github.com/softwareengineerprogrammer/GEOPHIRES/blob/9c7d95648140886609776f154d25a0dcbf240851/References/GEOPHIRES_v3_UserManual.pdf>`__
and the
`README Documentation <https://github.com/NREL/GEOPHIRES-X?tab=readme-ov-file#documentation>`__
in the GitHub repository.


While the User Manual provides a comprehensive, point-in-time snapshot of the software, this Reference Manual contains the most current and authoritative documentation for components that are frequently updated. For topics such as GEOPHIRES Parameters, for example, this manual should be considered the primary source of truth.
