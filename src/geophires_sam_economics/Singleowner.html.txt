PySAM.Singleowner.from_existing(data, optional config) → Singleowner

    Share data with an existing PySAM class. If optional config is a valid configuration name, load the module’s defaults for that configuration.

Singleowner is a wrapper for the SSC compute module cmod_singleowner.cpp
Interdependent Variables

The variables listed below are interdependent with other variables. If you change the value of one of these variables, you may need to change values of other variables. The SAM user interface manages these interdependent variables, but in PySAM, it is up to you change the value of all interdependent variables so they are consistent. See Interdependent Variables for examples and details.
