# HIP-RA-X: Under development

HIP-RA-X will be the successor version to HIP-RA.
As of 2024-01-31, HIP-RA-X is still under development and should not be used for actual calculations until work is
complete. (This README should be updated or deleted once HIP-RA-X is ready to be used as a replacement for HIP-RA.)
