---- This case study is a commercial-scale demonstration of a first-of-a-kind enhanced geothermal system.
---- The reservoir is a 7700-foot deep; 2800 kg/m3 density; 1000 J/kg/K heat capacity; 2.7 W/m/K thermal conductivity reservoir.
---- The reservoir has 87 fractures; each 750 feet high; 1000 feet wide; and 30 feet apart.
---- The reservoir has a 72.86 degree temperature gradient.
---- The second paper figure 4 shows a drilling cost that has plateaued and about $400 per foot. GEOPHIRES cannot
---- handle a drilling cost estimate on a per foot basis but drilling cost correlation of VERTICAL_LARGE_INT1 (10)
---- has a cost of $397.12 per foot at 7700 feet so we will use that.
---- NOTES:
-------- The paper does not discuss stimulation costs which could be substantially more than the default values used here.
-------- The paper does not discuss makeup water - how much what cost etc.
-------- The paper does not discuss redrilling or rentry to refrac etc.
