Number of Multilateral Sections, 0, -- This parameter is set to 0 because, for this case study, the cost of horizontal drilling (which would otherwise account for approximately 118 multilateral sections) is included within the 'vertical drilling cost.' This approach allows us to more directly convey the overall well drilling and completion cost, which is under $4 million.
