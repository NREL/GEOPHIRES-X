Well Drilling and Completion Capital Cost Adjustment Factor, 0.8, -- Adjust correlation-calculated value of $4.72M/well to $3.96M/well per Tim Latimer on 2025-02-12 Volts podcast: less than $4M/well

Reservoir Stimulation Capital Cost per Injection Well, 4, -- Baseline stimulation cost of $4.0M, calibrated from high-intensity U.S. shale well analogue (~$39k/frac stage for 102 stages). This is a pre-contingency value and excludes EGS-specific cost premiums such as ceramic proppant and HPHT hardware.
Reservoir Stimulation Capital Cost per Production Well, 4, -- Baseline stimulation cost of $4.0M, calibrated from high-intensity U.S. shale well analogue (~$39k/frac stage for 102 stages). This is a pre-contingency value and excludes EGS-specific cost premiums such as ceramic proppant and HPHT hardware.
Reservoir Stimulation Indirect Capital Cost Percentage, 0, -- Baseline stimulation cost includes indirect costs

Field Gathering System Capital Cost Adjustment Factor, 0.54, -- Gathering costs represent 2% of facilities CAPEX per https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fervo-energy-technology-day-2024-entering-geothermal-decade-matson-n4stc/
