GEOPHIRES v3.0 Input File
Geothermal Combined Heat and Power Problem using a Thermal Drawdown Reservoir Model and BICYCLE Economic Model and Solid Sorbent Direct Air Capture powered by geothermal

Based on Example 3 description: This example problem considers an EGS reservoir at 3.1km depth. 
The heat is used in a combined heat and power topping cycle model with double flash as
topping cycle and electricity considered as the main product. 

But only lists those patameters that are different than their default values
