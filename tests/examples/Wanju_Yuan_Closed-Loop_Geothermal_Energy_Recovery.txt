# Example: Geothermal Electricity Example Problem using Percentage Thermal Drawdown Model and closed loops
# Description: This example problem considers a simple reservoir
# at 2 km depth with an initial production temperature of 145deg.C. The thermal drawdown
# is assumed linear at 0.5%/year. The heat is converted to electricity with a subcritical
# ORC. It is accessed by a closed loop well.
