Geothermal Electricity Example Problem using Percentage Thermal Drawdown Model (Example X) and closed loops
Oringinally created by NREL on 3/26/2018 as Example 4
Last modified on 2/26/2023

Example X Description: This example problem considers a simple reservoir 
at 2 km depth with an initial production temperature of 145deg.C. The thermal drawdown 
is assumed linear at 0.5%/year. The heat is converted to electricity with a subcritical
ORC. It is accessed by a closed loop well.
