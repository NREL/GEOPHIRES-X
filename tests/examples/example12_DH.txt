GEOPHIRES v2.0 Input File
Geothermal Electricity Example Problem using Percentage Thermal Drawdown Model (Example 4)
Created by Charley Walton on 7/25/2022

Description: This example considers Cornell's existing district heating network assesses
the performance of a proposed geothermal well. A known heat demand profile for the district
is processed using the district_heat.py module See Charley Walton's SULI Research Report
"Techno-Economic Simulations of Geothermal District Heating Systems with GEOPHIRES" for
more details on the case study.

Note: The GEOPHIRES v2.0 python code scans the input file for each necessary "parameter,
value". Therefore, the user cannot change the string before the parameter value and the
comma is the required delimeter. Each paramater string may only appear once in this
input file. However, the parameters can be in any order and comments can be added
either by including extra lines or by typing it after the parameter value, separated by
a comma (see examples below). If a necessary parameter is not provided, a default value
is assumed, and a warning message is printed to the console.
