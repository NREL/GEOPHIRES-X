Geothermal Direct-Use Example Problem using a Linear Heat Sweep Model.

Example 2 Description: This problem considers an EGS reservoir at 3km depth.
Ramey's model is applied to simulate production wellbore heat losses. The heat
is used in direct-use heat application with reinjection temperature of 70deg.C
