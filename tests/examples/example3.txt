Geothermal Combined Heat and Power Problem using a Thermal Drawdown Reservoir Model and BICYCLE Economic Model

Example 3 description: This example problem considers an EGS reservoir at 3.1km depth.
The heat is used in a combined heat and power topping cycle model with double flash as
topping cycle and electricity considered as the main product.
