Geothermal Electricity Example Problem using Percentage Thermal Drawdown Model (Example 4)
Created by NREL on 3/26/2018
Last modified on 6/12/2018

Example 4 Description: This example problem considers a simple hydrothermal reservoir
at 2 km depth with an initial production temperature of 145deg.C. The thermal drawdown
is assumed linear at 0.5%/year. The heat is converted to electricity with a subcritical
ORC.
