# Example: SAM Single Owner PPA Economic Model: Multiple Construction Years
# FIXME WIP
# This example demonstrates the SAM Single Owner PPA Economic Model for a 50 MWe EGS project with similar engineering parameters to Fervo Cape Station.
# The SAM Single Owner PPA Economic Model calculates project NPV， after-tax IRR， and cash flow based on
# electricity production， capital costs， and economic input parameters.
# See "SAM Economic Models" in GEOPHIRES documentation: https://nrel.github.io/GEOPHIRES-X/SAM-Economic-Models.html
