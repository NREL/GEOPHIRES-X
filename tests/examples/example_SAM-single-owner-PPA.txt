# Example: SAM Single Owner PPA Economic Model: 50 MWe
# This example demonstrates a 50 MWe EGS project with similar engineering parameters to Fervo Cape Station.
# The SAM Single Owner PPA Economic Model calculates project NPV, after-tax IRR, and cash flow based on
# electricity production, capital costs, and economic input parameters.
