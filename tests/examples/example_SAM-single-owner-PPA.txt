# Example: SAM Single Owner PPA Economic Model
# This example is adapted from Fervo_Project_Cape-3, allowing for comparison between BICYCLE and SAM economic models.
# See "SAM Economic Models" in GEOPHIRES documentation for details on how GEOPHIRES parameters and outputs are transformed and passed
# to the SAM financial model.
