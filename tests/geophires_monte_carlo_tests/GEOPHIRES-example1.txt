Geothermal Electricity Problem using a Multiple Parallel Fractures Model

Example 1 Description: This problem considers an EGS reservoir at 3km depth.
Ramey's model is applied to simulate production wellbore heat losses. The heat
is used in for electricity application with a reinjection temperature of 50deg.C.
